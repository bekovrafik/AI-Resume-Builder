Running Gradle task 'bundleRelease'...                          
Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.5.2) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/Users/bekovrafik/Documents/GetKoji/Resume Builder/AI-Resume-Builder/mobile_app/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/Users/bekovrafik/Documents/GetKoji/Resume Builder/AI-Resume-Builder/mobile_app/android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Font asset "CupertinoIcons.ttf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 257628 to 848 bytes (99.7% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 8824 bytes (99.5% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.

	uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 21 cannot be smaller than version 23 declared in library [com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:23.2.1] /Users/bekovrafik/.gradle/caches/8.11.1/transforms/55bb47ebb0163d8e76a104b9e27ee4f5/transformed/jetified-firebase-auth-23.2.1/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 21
	Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 21,
		or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 23,
